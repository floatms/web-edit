# web-edit
This was supposed to be a web-based text/code-editor that respects mobile screen space (no unnecessary padding / small windows etc. etc.).
It was also a half failed experiment to add a custom toolbar to the mobile keyboard that enables fast access to commonly needed characters + 
a "command mode" that enables easier navigation of the text. All of this is kind of useless and unpolished and way to complex for mobile, but I still use
the editor sometimes, mainly for the large editor window. Only works kind of on mobile Chrome.
